Inspiration for this app was my work in Wood Technology Institute, where I was doing auditor work for wood industry certification.<br />
<br>Workflow of the documents, and whole certification process, from beginning to end was based on handmade notes and paper documents.<br />
<br>There was no system or tool that would help auditors do their work whatsoever, only one's people knowledge and lots of document binders.<br />
<br>This specific certificate, which was IPPC certificate was mandatory for international shipping of wooden packages and other wooden goods.<br />
<br>It's purpose was to assure that wood in plant underwent heat treatment in order to disinfect wood from invasive microorganisms and insects,<br />
<br>and It had to be renewed once every 2 years. The list of manufacturers with active is public and available at institute's site:<br />

<br>Polish wood industry is quite large, as there was 700+ enterprises with active certificate, and to work with that number means <br />
<br>lot of paper work, and checking if everyone's status is correct.<br />
<br>Very often during audit, there's need for subject to send some additional documents, or implement some changes.<br />
<br>In this case there was need for checking on it in some given time if he sent required documents or implemented advised changes.<br />
<br>Keeping track of it was very hard, and decentralized, as every auditor had it's own subjected enterprises.<br />
