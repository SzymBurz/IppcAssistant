## Workflow

Whole auditory work in wood industry consists of once every 2 years audits for enterprises that want to have their certificate reneved.

We can filter and export data about choosen enterprises as text. We can set new audit for enterprise wit future date.
After trip, we can settle it, adding conducted audits and adding expenses to summary. In this case we can also export interesting us data.
If subject didn't fulfill requirements for audit, eg. some documents missing or inadequate equipement, there's option for setting reminder that 
it should send us this document in given time, or proof of fiing the issue. This, and upcoming audits are minitored by calendar.
